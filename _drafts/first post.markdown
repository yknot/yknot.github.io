Motivation
=====

With the start of my new job as a Database Engineer and becoming a professional programmer of sorts you would think that coming home and doing more programming would not be first on my list. Well it turns out the opposite is true and the new position is what motivated me to look into tons of new projects. Now what better to document the successes and inevitable struggles of these than a blog. Well now that sounds like a project in itself.


Why Jekyll?
=====

When it comes to making a blog I looked around at a lot of different methods. Previously I had one hosted on Google's blogspot but I really thought that was more the cheaters way out. It did give me a lot of customization but I wanted to actually learn more about what I was creating in terms of HTML/CSS/JavaScript etc. But at the same time I didn't want to make it an arduous task to update the darn thing.

Enter Jekyll. You create the site from scratch just like you would any site but then you can automate the creation of static webpage posts so that you don't have to worry about it again. You can even write them in markdown, as I am right now!

The next step was how to host it. Luckily GitHub pages was available and runs Jekyll! Aren't the stars aligning so perfectly? With all these easy decisions made next was actually getting the website going, this would take a lot of work as I was pretty far out of my depth to begin with.
