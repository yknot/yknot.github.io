<h1><a>Reading (10 Books)</a></h1>

<h2>Books</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671042262">The Blue Nowhere</a> by Jeffery Deaver
  <br>
  This was a really fun quick read. Picked it up at a bookstore on a ski trip and finished it in only a couple days. The context of Silicon Valley and hacking was interesting to me being a computer science major. It was interesting to read about the state of the internet and hacking in 2001 and even earlier.

<h3>In Progress</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical/dp/0143127535">How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking</a> by Jordan Ellenberg
</p>
<h2>AudioBooks</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wrinkle-Time-Quintet/dp/0312367546">A Wrinkle in Time</a> by Madeleine L'Engle
  <br>
This was a good book, obviously meant for a younger crowd, but I wanted to read it before the movie. I also think that by reading this I will want to read the rest of the series.
