Hi there! I'm Andrew. I'm a Database Engineer at S&P Capital IQ in New York City. I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2014 with a Bachelor's Degree in Industrial and Management Engineering with a Minor in Economics.

When I'm not working I enjoy coding for fun through working on projects such as making this website. A full list of my projects are included below.

I also enjoy photography and am making (or already have) a dedicated photos section to this site to show off display some of my favorites. I use a Nikon D3100 to shoot all of my stills them and edit them in Adobe Lightroom. I also use a Contour Camera to shoot when I'm doing more active things such as [skiing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0YpsklfiHo&list=UUusFf2MvO4jJK2zv7I3Ti0A). 


I'm also an outdoor enthusiast and love to hike, ski and play ultimate, as you can probably tell from some of my photos. As part of my hiking passion I am almost a [46er](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Forty-Sixers) and have a goal of hiking the highest peak in all [50 states](http://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=12003&cid=5354).
