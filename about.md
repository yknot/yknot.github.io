Hi there! I'm Andrew. I am currently a Computer Science PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I recieved my undergrad RPI in Industrial and Management Engineering with a Minor in Economics. After my undergrad I worked for a year as a Database Engineer at S&P Capital IQ in New York City.

Outside of school I also enjoy photography and am making a dedicated photos section to this site to show off display some of my favorites. I use a Nikon D3100 to shoot all of my stills them and edit them in Adobe Lightroom. I also use a Contour Camera to shoot when I'm doing more active things such as [skiing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0YpsklfiHo&list=UUusFf2MvO4jJK2zv7I3Ti0A). 


I'm also an outdoor enthusiast and love to hike, ski and play ultimate, as you can probably tell from some of my photos. As part of my hiking passion I am almost a [46er](http://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=5120&cid=5354) and have a goal of hiking the highest peak in all [50 states](http://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=12003&cid=5354).
