Mediator Theme
===

At first I wanted to start from scratch and build the entire theme and layouts for this blog by myself. Then I realizd that there are much better designers in the world than myself (like pretty much all of them). So I decided to take the easy way out. I am now using a theme for Jekyll. I got it off of [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/). I decided that having at least the beginning of a theme would help me learn faster.


Modifications
===

I changed some of the Mediator theme already to get it to work for me. All pretty trivial stuff so far.

* Cover image
* Logo image
* Name of blog
* Footer text
* Social media links
* Remove featured posts (commented in case of future use)

That's a good start but there is still much more to be done. Right now I have a working list but I'm sure that more will change.

* Minor CSS changes to customize and get familiar with it
* RSS feed integration
* About page
* Photos subsite

But for now I'm excited that the page doesn't look terrible anymore and that I can be proud to show it off!
